Practicing concepts of GitHub Actions. 

## Part 1: Step 4 - Feedback on GitHub Actions Quickstart

Feedback note:
The guide was helpful, but could use more clarity. I couldn't locate the 'log' window, and there was no guidance on where to find it. A clearer definition of key terms like 'jobs' and 'logs' would be useful, along with an explanation of what logs to expect and their parameters. Additionally, a simple real-world example would make concepts more intuitive. That said, I understand this is meant as a 'QuickStart' rather than an in-depth guide.
